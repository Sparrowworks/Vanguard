# What is Vanguard?
 A versatile library designed for 2D weapon creation in Godot. We seek to empower developers to construct weapons with essential functionalities while offering extensive customization options, akin to building with a LEGO set. This approach allows for both simplicity and creativity, making it suitable for a wide range of game projects and allowing developers to build upon it as they see fit.
 It is focused solely on weapon mechanics, intentionally excluding health, physics, stealth, and other gameplay elements.
