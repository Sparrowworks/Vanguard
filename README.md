# Vanguard

## An Open-Source 2D Weapon system for Godot Games.

Vanguard is a simple 2D weapon system catered to hobbyists, begginers and alike. It provides a set of classes to: 
* Build weapons with like [Ranged](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/ranged/ranged.gd).
* Create arrows, bullets and all sorts of projectiles using [Projectile](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/projectile/projectile.gd).
* Create explosion, noise and status-effect inducing (poison, burning...) areas with [Field](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/field/field.gd).
* Build upon a core [Weapon](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/weapon/weapon.gd) class and create your own custom classes and weapon types.
* Copy and "mass produce" like [Melee](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/melee/melee.tscn), [Hitbox](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/hitbox/hitbox.gd) and [Hurtbox](https://github.com/VargaDot/Vanguard/blob/main/blueprints/hurtbox/hurtbox.gd).
