class_name Projectile
extends Area2D

## The base class for all damage-causing object-destroying projectiles
##
## This script serves as a foundation for creating various types of projectiles that can inflict damage on targets within the game.

## A timer used to manage the fate of the projectile after it has reached 0.
var TIMER:Timer
@export_group("Projectile Stats")
## Ranges from 0.0 (poor accuracy) to 1.0 (high accuracy), Determines how precisely the projectile will hit its target.
@export var accuracy:float
## Defines the maximum angle of deviation for the projectile when fired at zero accuracy.
@export var max_spread:int
## Specifies how far the projectile can travel before it is considered ineffective or destroyed.
@export var projectile_range:int # to evade warning "The variable "range" has the same name as a built-in function."
## The velocity at which the projectile travels in the game world
@export var speed:int

@export_group("Projectile Emissions")
## Slot for custom field
@export var field:PackedScene
## Slot for custom projectile
@export var projectile:PackedScene

## Internal Vector2 pointing to the right along the X-axis
